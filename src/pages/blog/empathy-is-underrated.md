["When you genuinely care about your team members' development, they're more likely to ... take risks, innovate"](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/importance-empathetic-managers-engineering-teams-alfredo-temprano/)

I felt like one of my deadly sins being managing an engineering team in the past has been the lack of empathy to the ones I manage. It wasn't about the processes, nor the team's skill set, or a shiny new PM tool that was marketed to "10x team's performance". As engineers, we tend to use our logical thinking more than we use our emotional senses, because we're in a field that conditioned us to think that way. The problem arise when shit gets hard, especially in a small but fast team environment a la a startup, and you're the man in charge for all things engineering. No matter how stressful you are, never forget to be a good person to those under you. When you interact with those who work under you, you must understand that there's an inherent power disbalance; this disbalance is often deafening, and you need to make sure they get a chance to speak--not just about engineering and working, but also how they're feeling right now.

If you don't create this safe space, you lose employee royalty. In a small organization, you can't afford to lose royalty, because losing an employee is losing a big piece in the pie, compared to if you have a lot more employees in a bigger organization. In fact, employee royalty has very little to do with the current face of your organization. Here comes a paradox: it's interesting how sometimes in startups we need people that live and die by us, but yet we don't care about them enough. Founders encourage employees to take ownership in a startup, but they never enabled then to take it in the first place; telling them to take ownership without enabling it is like trying to light up a bonfire without wood and oil--you keep trying to use your lighter that can barely ignite anything, because you don't even have the resources that you need in the first place (i.e., your people).

TLDR; if I'm an EM, and I have to choose between having a great engineering background, versus having great EQ, I would choose the latter every time. Your engineers are the one who needs to be empowered to do great things; you're their cheerleader--without them, you're nothing. Be your engineers' best advocate.
