If you think about software as clothes, you're probably right.

Software has been such a huge part of our lives that nowadays, we have all developed a certain taste. Just like how we develop taste in clothes and how we invented this concept of "fashion", software have always had its own "fashion", and like clothes, this changes over time. There was a period when using BootstrapCSS for your HTML app was fashionable; it was kind of the only thing that existed that allows you to build nice-looking apps fast. Over the last 2 years or so, people started going very modern. This is the kind of style you see in Vercel or Linear: the glossy look, rounded but sharp-looking borders, mostly dark background tones with white or white-ish text. Rise of libraries like ChakraUI and TailwindCSS, and most recently shadcn/ui, allowed devs to build beautiful UIs fast without compromising hours on end fiddling with pure CSS. Eventually, this "fashion" becomes the de-facto way people build product interfaces; any examples that deviates from this and looks worse is considered not superior. Looks matter. Considering consumer software would be used by many people for the majority of their time, it needs to **look good**.

Of course, UIs are important, but they only scratch the interface part. That's why there's UX: the study of creating better and better user experience. Eye candying alone is not good enough. UX is accompanied by moments of magic where users can swiftly accomplish the task at hand with little to no friction. [Software design can take a page from how games were designed](https://a16z.com/game-design-not-gamification-for-great-products/#:~:text=In%20this%20talk%20from%20the,that%20retain%20and%20delight%20users.); users should be able to do what they want to do quickly and efficiently. The best example of this is why Linear beats Jira by a large margin for modern startups.
